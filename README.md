# Phasmophobia Overlay

An improved version of the in-game journal in Phasmophobia. Designed to be used as a stream overlay.

## What's different?

- Journal considers _Ghost Orbs_ forced evidence for The Mimic.
- Journal will appropriately rule out ghosts based on the number of available evidence.
- Journal will rule out female only ghosts when the ghost is selected as male.
- Evidence can be crossed out on lower evidence runs without ruling out potential ghosts.
- Timer included to make tracking certain events easier.
- List shows ghost hunting thresholds.
- Option to filter out ghosts by their observed speed when _unaware of the player_.

## How do I use this?

Either download the provided `.html` file or use the live version (coming soon) with a streaming software such as OBS. You can then either:

- Capture the browser window itself using Window Source.
- Capture the local file or the URL and interact with the Browser Source (recommended for transparency).
